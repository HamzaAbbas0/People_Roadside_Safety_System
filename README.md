# People_Roadside_Safety_System
Are you passionate about enhancing pedestrian safety on busy roads? Do you envision a world where technology contributes to safer road crossings for everyone? Look no further â€“ I'm here to turn your vision into reality!

Project Overview:
Imagine a scenario where pedestrians can confidently cross the road, knowing that their safety is a top priority. In this innovative project, I leverage the power of the Raspberry Pi Zero W to create a cutting-edge roadside safety system that brings this vision to life. This system combines smart technology with user-friendly design to ensure the safety of pedestrians and promote harmonious interaction between pedestrians and drivers.

Key Features:

Pedestrian Detection: Using advanced sensors and computer vision techniques, the system can detect pedestrians approaching the road, triggering the safety mechanism.

LED Blinking Alerts: As a pedestrian steps onto the road, the system activates LED lights strategically positioned at the roadside. These lights flash in a noticeable pattern, alerting drivers to the pedestrian's presence and encouraging them to slow down and yield.

Customization Options: Every environment is unique, and the system can be tailored to suit specific road conditions, lighting scenarios, and pedestrian traffic patterns.

Real-time Responsiveness: The system's real-time responsiveness ensures that it reacts swiftly to changing situations, maximizing its effectiveness in preventing accidents.

Low Maintenance: Built with efficiency and durability in mind, the system requires minimal maintenance, making it a cost-effective and sustainable solution.
